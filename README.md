# API Testing Automation Project

This project is a **REST API testing framework** built with **Java**, **JUnit 5**, and **Rest-Assured**.  
It demonstrates automated testing of different API endpoints with validation of responses, headers, status codes, and JSON content.

## Project Overview

- Automated testing for **GET, POST, and PUT requests**.  
- Validated **status codes, response headers, and response times**.  
- Handled and verified **JSON request and response payloads**.
